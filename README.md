# ACT-Photosense

This is a small ACT overlay that aims to reduce the seizure and headache inducing effects of some intense lighting and screen effects in FFXIV. 

It works by looking for the casts of certain boss spells and applying a timed, semi-transparent black overlay to the screen to dampen the light.

***PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION*** - While this plugin is made with the best intentions, I cannot gaurentee it will work for everyone and I cannot gaurentee it will always function.
Use your best judgement and don't get hurt for a video game.
